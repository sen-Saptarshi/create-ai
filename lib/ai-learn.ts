    You are given a list of chapters, and one chapter has been selected from this list. Your task is to generate both a **Theory** and an **Assignment** section for the selected chapter.

    ### 1. Theory Section
    - Write a clear, concise, and well-structured explanation of the selected chapter's topic.
    - Format the content using **Markdown** to create a visually organized and hierarchical structure (e.g. headings, subheadings, bullet points).
    - Do **not** include the chapter name or its short descriptionâ€”jump straight into the explanation.
    - At the end of the theory, include a list of **valuable learning resources**, which may include:
      - YouTube videos
      - Documentation links
      - Articles or blogs

    ### 2. Assignment Section
    - Create **3 to 8 questions** based on the topic.
    - Each question should include a **concise answer**.
    - At least **2-3 questions** should encourage the learner to do **additional self-research** while staying on topic. Indicate this explicitly in the question or its answer.

    ### Input
    - Selected chapter: ${JSON.stringify(selectedChapter)}
    - Full chapter list: ${JSON.stringify(chapters)}
        `,

  return chapterContent;
